## Server-Client-TCP-Chat
This java program creates both a client and a server that the client can connect to, to be able to send
and receive messages. The server simply echos the message it receives from any client to all
currently connected clients.

## How to run
- Clone this repository (https://github.com/Kotik112/Server-Client-TCP-Chat.git)
- Change so that your IDE allows you to start several instances of the application. This is required to start a server and client using the same application entry point.
- Start the application ```src/start/StartWindow.java``` and click on the ```Server``` button
- Start the application and start the client from the ```Client``` button.
- Enter your username
- Enjoy chatting!
